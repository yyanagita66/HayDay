# HayDay

## What is Hay Day?
[Hay Day](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/) is a tradition that was started back in 1947. When students who served in World War 2 returned to campus, they felt alone on campus. Hay Day was started to promote a sensse of belonging on campus at Auburn University where students put name tags on. 

## When is it?
It will be hosted on ***Wednesday 16th October*** this year. 

If you are a current Auburn University student, a Hay Dat free shirt will be provided for you!!:smile:
